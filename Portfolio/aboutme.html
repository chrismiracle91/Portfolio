            <h1>About Chris Miracle</h1>

            <h4>Web Development and Programming</h4>
            <p>My programming experience includes C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience building websites in WordPress, Joomla, Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>I have worked on several school projects using all of these skills that are showcased on the Projects page. I also have upcoming projects planned including, building a WordPress site for a merchandise company my brother is starting up, and building personal websites for streamers and content creators.</p>

            <h4>Personal Life</h4>
            <p>I am an avid sports fan, and played sports my whole life. These experiences have shaped me into a strong leader, and someone who works well in a team environment.  I take pride in knowing how to help others reach their full potential as well as knowing when to ask for help when I need it. Watching and playing sports has also turned me into a more analytical thinker, always contemplating ways for things to be more efficient or to work better than they currently do.</p>
            <p>I enjoy being outdoors, hiking, going to the beach, and enjoying nature. This gives me a great appreciation for our place in the world and how everything we do impacts everything around us. I will always carry this with me in my work trying to reduce the size of my carbon footprint and leave the world better than I found it.</p>
            <p>I also greatly enjoy the digital world, and all that comes with it. I am a creator at heart, I love creating content of all types. I play video games, am learning how to edit video, and I am passionate about Web Development.</p>

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>I have a lot of goals in life, some of which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Become a confident Web Developer with a vast and diverse portfolio</li>
                <li>Blend all of my skills and passions into a career that gives me satisfaction in life</li>
                <li>Leave a lasting impact on the world in some way</li>
                <li>Make my family's life better</li>
                <li>Always learn something new every single day and continue to grow as a person and as a Web Developer</li>
            </ul>
